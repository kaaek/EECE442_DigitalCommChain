function xq = quan(x, thr, lvl)
    % quan - Quantizes the input signal based on specified thresholds and levels. This is a helper function for the Uniform quantizer.
    %
    % Syntax:
    %   xq = quan(x, thr, lvl)
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   x   - Input signal to be quantized mse vs quantization level M(vector).
    %   thr - Thresholds for quantization (vector). The length of thr should be one less than the length of lvl.
    %   lvl - Levels corresponding to the thresholds (vector). The length of lvl should be one more than the length of thr.
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   xq  - Quantized output signal (vector) of the same size as input x.
    %
    % Description:
    %   The function quantizes the input signal x based on the provided thresholds and levels. 
    %   Each value in x is replaced by the corresponding level based on the defined thresholds.
    %   If a value in x is less than or equal to the first threshold, it is assigned the first level.
    %   If it is greater than the last threshold, it is assigned the last level. 
    %   Values between thresholds are assigned the corresponding levels.
    xq = zeros(size(x));
    for i = 1:length(x)
        x_i = x(i);
        assigned = false;
        for j = 1:length(thr)
            % Check if the current input value is less than or equal to the current threshold
            if x_i <= thr(j)
                xq(i) = lvl(j);
                assigned = true;
                break;
            end
        end
        % Assign the last level if no thresholds were met
        if ~assigned
            xq(i) = lvl(end);
        end
    end
